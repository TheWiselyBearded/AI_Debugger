# VR Debugging Tool with GPT Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a Unity-based VR debugging tool that leverages GPT for runtime analysis. The tool scans the VR environment for objects within a specified proximity and uses Reflection to gather information about their classes, methods, and variables. This data is then analyzed by GPT to provide insights into the relationships among components and their runtime values.

## Features
- Proximity-based scanning of VR objects.
- Reflection to gather detailed information about object classes.
- Integration with GPT for advanced analysis of runtime environment.
- Continuous updates and improvements.
