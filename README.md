# AI Unity Debugging Tool with GPT Assistants

Welcome to **ai-debugger**! This framework allows you to create a powerful OpenAI Assistant, "the dope coder," tailored to work with your Unity project's files. At runtime, the assistant utilizes reflection and a simple UI, enabling you to ask questions about the runtime environment and project codebase using voice or text. Additionally, it provides the ability to review runtime values for any active class.

In the Unity Editor, you can traverse your filesystem and selectively upload files to the assistant's vector store, enhancing its understanding and response accuracy. The tool is designed for both VR and non-VR Unity projects, providing advanced analysis and insights into the relationships among components, their runtime behaviors, and overall code functionality.

## Features

- **Voice and Text Interaction**: Communicate with the assistant using voice or text.
- **Runtime Reflection**: Query the runtime environment and get detailed responses about your project's codebase.
- **Proximity-based scene scanning**: Scan objects with filters (e.g., colliders, distance, library/namespace).
- **Class Value Inspection**: Review runtime values for any active class.
- **Selective File Upload**: Traverse your filesystem in the Unity Editor and upload files to the assistant's vector store.
- **Simple UI**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the assistant.

### In-Editor
1. Obtain your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and configure it in the assistant setup.
2. Open the "Dope Coder" window from the Unity Editor menu by selecting **Tools > Dope Coder > GPT Assistant Builder**.
3. In the GPT Assistant Builder window, create a new assistant or load/edit an existing assistant.
   - To create a new assistant, enter the assistant name, instruction, and select the model.
   - To load an existing assistant, choose from the list and click "Load."
4. Use the file system traversal feature to select and upload files to the assistant's vector store.
5. Save and configure the assistant as needed.

### At Runtime
1. Start your Unity project.
2. Interact with the assistant through the provided UI.
3. Use voice or text input to ask questions about the runtime environment and project codebase.
4. Inspect runtime values for any active class using the reflection features.
